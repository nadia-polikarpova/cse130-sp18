### Homework Assignments (45%)

There will be *six* programming assignments,
assigned every one or two weeks.
Instructions on turning them in will be posted with
each assignment.

**Partners**

- You can work on the assignment *either alone or in groups of two*.
- *Every student* has to turn in their solution,
even if their solution is identical to their partner's.

<!--

**Late Policy**

You have a total of *eight late days* that you can use throughout the quarter,
but no more than *four late days* per assignment.
    
- A late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline    
- If you submit past the late day limit, you get 0 points for that assignment
- There is no penalty for submitting late but within the limit
      
### Midterm (25%)

Will be held on **Monday May 4**.
The format will be announced before the midterm.

### Final (30%)
  
Will be held on **Friday June 12**.
The format will be announced before the final.
  
Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as 
`midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`.
This means that you get a second chance if you donâ€™t do well on the midterm but 
you must turn in both the midterm and the final.

### Discussions (+5%)

Extra credit for top-20 best participants in Piazza discussions,
determined by the instruction team.
